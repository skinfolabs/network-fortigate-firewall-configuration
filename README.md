## Project Overview

This project documents a FortiGate firewall lab focused on secure access, identity-aware policy design, VPN connectivity, internal service publishing, and layered threat prevention. FortiGate acts as the central enforcement point between the WAN, the internal LAN, remote VPN users, and protected internal services.

The walkthrough combines three security areas: administrative control, remote-access and publishing paths, and traffic inspection. It covers administrator RBAC, password hardening, LDAP integration, SSL VPN Tunnel Mode, SSL VPN Web Mode, Virtual IP publishing, site-to-site IPsec VPN, SSL/TLS inspection, web filtering, DNS filtering, antivirus inspection, intrusion prevention, application control, and quarantine.

The security focus is least privilege, controlled remote access, service-restricted firewall policy, encrypted traffic inspection, content filtering, malware-prevention testing, botnet/C2 protection, and validation through client behavior and FortiGate logs.

## Objectives

- Define the FortiGate placement, interfaces, trusted networks, and external traffic path.
- Implement role-based administrative access with named accounts and restricted profiles.
- Apply a FortiGate password policy to local administrators and IPsec pre-shared keys.
- Integrate Active Directory identities through LDAP for group-based remote access.
- Configure and validate SSL VPN Tunnel Mode and browser-based Web Mode access.
- Publish an internal IIS service through destination NAT and a controlled inbound policy.
- Build a site-to-site IPsec VPN with directional service restrictions.
- Inspect encrypted and application traffic with FortiGate security profiles.
- Validate allowed and blocked behavior through client results, VPN status, and FortiGate logs.
