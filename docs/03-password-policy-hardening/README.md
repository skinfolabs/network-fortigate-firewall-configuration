# FortiGate Password Policy Hardening

This chapter documents local FortiGate password-policy hardening for administrator credentials and IPsec pre-shared keys. It separates the lab enforcement baseline from the stronger credential controls expected in a production firewall deployment.

## Technical Context

Password controls reduce the chance that locally managed FortiGate credentials or IPsec pre-shared keys can be guessed through dictionary, brute-force, or weak-password attacks. The configured policy requires at least eight characters and a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

The selected scope is `Both`. On FortiGate, this applies to locally defined administrator passwords and IPsec VPN pre-shared keys; it does not replace the Active Directory password policy for LDAP users. Eight characters are suitable for demonstrating the control in a lab, while production environments should prefer longer passwords or passphrases and multi-factor authentication.

> Password policy scope is important because FortiGate cannot impose this local setting on credentials stored in Active Directory. LDAP users remain governed by the domain's account policy, while this FortiGate control protects the local administrative and IPsec secrets managed on the firewall.

**Implemented controls:**

- Enabled the FortiGate password policy.
- Applied the policy to administrator passwords and IPsec pre-shared keys.
- Required multiple character classes to reduce predictable password choices.
- Documented the stronger password and MFA expectations for production use.

## Key Technical Terms

| Term | Meaning in this chapter |
|------|-------------------------|
| Password policy | A rule set that defines length and complexity requirements for accepted local secrets. |
| Scope `Both` | The FortiGate setting that applies the local policy to administrator passwords and IPsec pre-shared keys. |
| Pre-shared key | A shared secret used by VPN peers to authenticate each other during tunnel negotiation. |
| MFA | Multi-Factor Authentication, a production control that adds a second proof beyond a password. |

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 01 - Configure the password policy

The password-policy page is opened under the FortiGate system settings and the scope is set to `Both`. The minimum length and character requirements are then configured so newly accepted local administrator passwords and IPsec pre-shared keys must satisfy the defined baseline.

> Complexity requirements make simple guessing attacks more expensive, but they do not compensate for reused credentials or a compromised administrator session. Production protection should combine long unique secrets with MFA, restricted management access, monitoring, and timely credential rotation.

## Validation and Summary

Validation is configuration-based: the FortiGate policy screen shows the enabled scope, length, and character-class requirements. A production validation would also test rejected weak passwords and confirm MFA or centralized admin authentication where used.

This chapter defines the local credential baseline used by the FortiGate lab. The configuration evidence confirms the password-policy scope and complexity requirements while leaving production MFA and centralized identity controls as hardening recommendations.
