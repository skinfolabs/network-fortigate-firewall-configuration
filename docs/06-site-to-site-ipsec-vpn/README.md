# Site-to-Site IPsec VPN

This chapter documents FortiGate-to-FortiGate IPsec connectivity with directional service restrictions. It shows that an encrypted tunnel and a least-privilege inter-site policy are related but separate security controls.

---

## Purpose

Build an encrypted site-to-site VPN and show that the tunnel transport and directional firewall policies are separate security decisions.

## Technical Context

IPsec protects traffic between the New York and Tel Aviv private networks across an untrusted external path. Each FortiGate acts as a VPN peer: the devices authenticate one another, negotiate cryptographic parameters, and create an encrypted path for traffic that matches the defined private-network selectors.

The tunnel itself does not grant unlimited trust between the locations. Directional firewall policies are edited after tunnel creation so New York can test Tel Aviv with ping, while the reverse direction is intended to allow only RDP toward the New York systems.

> IPsec protects confidentiality and integrity while traffic crosses the public network, but firewall policy still controls what the connected sites may do. Treating a VPN as unrestricted LAN extension would allow a compromise at one site to spread more easily to the other.

**Implemented controls:**

- Created a FortiGate-to-FortiGate site-to-site tunnel.
- Configured the remote WAN gateway, outgoing interface, and PSK.
- Defined the New York and Tel Aviv protected networks.
- Reviewed the negotiated tunnel state.
- Applied directional ping and RDP service requirements.
- Tested allowed and denied behavior from both sides.

Production recommendation: the visible Tel Aviv-to-New York policy still shows `ALL` in the saved service field while the service picker highlights `RDP`. The intended least-privilege result requires saving the service as `RDP` and validating the rule again before production use.

## Steps Covered

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 01 - Start the FortiGate-to-FortiGate tunnel

The IPsec wizard is opened and the FortiGate-to-FortiGate site-to-site option is selected. This tells FortiOS that both endpoints are compatible firewall peers and prepares the Phase 1, Phase 2, routing, and policy objects required for the connection.

> Phase 1 establishes and authenticates the secure control channel between the peers. Phase 2 negotiates the IPsec security associations that protect the selected network traffic carried through the tunnel.

---

### Step 02 - Configure the remote gateway and PSK

The Tel Aviv WAN address `13.82.92.101` is entered as the remote gateway, `Port1` is selected as the outgoing interface, and both peers are configured with the same pre-shared key. These values allow the New York FortiGate to locate the correct remote peer and prove possession of the shared secret during negotiation.

> A PSK is a shared authentication secret, not an encryption algorithm. In production it should be long, randomly generated, stored securely, and rotated according to policy because disclosure would weaken peer authentication.

---

### Step 03 - Define the protected networks

The New York networks `10.90.1.0/24` and `10.90.11.0/24` are paired with the Tel Aviv networks `10.74.1.0/24` and `10.74.11.0/24`. These local and remote selectors identify the private address ranges that the peers should protect and ensure unrelated internet traffic does not enter this site-to-site tunnel.

> The selectors must be mirrored correctly on both FortiGate devices. If one peer defines different local or remote subnets, Phase 1 may succeed while Phase 2 or actual data traffic still fails.

---

### Step 04 - Confirm the tunnel state

After both peers complete their configuration, the IPsec monitor is opened to review the tunnel and Phase 2 state. An established tunnel confirms that the public endpoints can reach each other and agree on the authentication, encryption, and protected-network parameters.

> Tunnel status proves successful negotiation, not application permission. Cross-site ping or RDP can still fail because of firewall policy, routing, host firewalls, or an unavailable destination service.

---

### Step 05 - Limit New York-to-Tel Aviv traffic to ping

The New York-to-Tel Aviv policy is restricted to the `PING` service. ICMP echo traffic can therefore be used to verify basic cross-site reachability without granting general application access from New York into the Tel Aviv networks.

> Service restriction demonstrates least privilege between connected sites. The encrypted tunnel provides transport, while this directional policy limits the permitted use of that transport to the specific test required by the lab.

<p><sub><strong>Screenshot 051 - New York to Tel Aviv Ping Policy:</strong> The directional IPsec policy explicitly allows the PING service.</sub></p>


---

### Step 06 - Review the Tel Aviv-to-New York RDP rule

The reverse policy is intended to permit Tel Aviv users to reach New York systems only with RDP. The service-selection pane shows `RDP`, while the saved Service field in the same screenshot still displays `ALL`. This means the rule needs a final service correction before it fully matches the intended least-privilege design.

> For the least-privilege design to be complete, the saved service must be changed from `ALL` to `RDP` and validated again. Leaving `ALL` would allow any service accepted by the destination host, which is broader than the stated remote-administration requirement.

<p><sub><strong>Screenshot 052 - Tel Aviv to New York RDP Rule:</strong> RDP is selected in the service picker, while the policy field still shows `ALL` and therefore requires a final correction.</sub></p>


---

### Step 07 - Validate cross-site access

The two sides test the intended services after the tunnel is established. The combined validation screen records command-line reachability and an RDP connection attempt across the VPN, connecting the negotiated tunnel state with actual host-to-host traffic.

> Testing both the tunnel and the application separates cryptographic success from policy success. A VPN can be up while traffic is still blocked, so the final check must use the same source, destination, and service described by the rule.

<p><sub><strong>Screenshot 053 - Cross-Site Service Validation:</strong> Command-line and RDP tests are performed after the IPsec policies are applied.</sub></p>


---

### Step 08 - Compare validation from the remote site

The remote-side screenshots provide the opposite perspective of the same VPN. The RDP client is opened toward the permitted destination, while ping fails in the direction where ICMP is not allowed. Together these results show that the tunnel carries traffic in both directions but the intended services are evaluated directionally.

> A denied test is valuable evidence when denial is the expected policy result. The failed reverse ping demonstrates that encrypted connectivity does not automatically override the service restriction configured for that direction.

## Validation

Validation includes the negotiated tunnel state, allowed service tests, RDP behavior, and a denied reverse-ping result. The screenshots confirm the lab goal while also documenting the service-field issue that should be corrected for a production least-privilege rule.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter completes the site-to-site VPN workflow. The evidence confirms tunnel negotiation and service testing, while the visible `ALL` service field in the reverse policy remains a documented hardening item before production use.
