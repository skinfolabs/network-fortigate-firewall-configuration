# DNS Filtering

This chapter documents DNS Filtering for controlled domain blocking and DNS-filter log validation. It focuses on decisions made at the name-resolution layer before a browser completes normal access to a domain.

---

## Purpose

Filter risky or controlled domain lookups before the client completes normal access and validate the result through the workstation and FortiGate DNS logs.

## Technical Context

DNS filtering evaluates domain-resolution requests before the client establishes the full application connection. FortiGate can compare queried names with FortiGuard threat intelligence, block domains associated with botnet or command-and-control activity, and apply organization-defined static rules for controlled destinations.

This exercise enables C&C protection and then uses Facebook as a safe demonstration domain. The static rule redirects the test request to a FortiGate block portal, and both the client result and DNS-filter log are retained to show enforcement.

> DNS filtering acts early in the connection process by preventing or changing name resolution. It does not inspect every later packet to the destination, so layered controls such as firewall policy, Web Filter, IPS, and Application Control still remain important.

**Implemented controls:**

- Created `Office_DNS_Filter`.
- Enabled known botnet and C&C domain protection.
- Added a controlled wildcard domain rule.
- Applied the DNS filter to outbound traffic.
- Validated the client warning and corresponding DNS logs.

## Key Technical Terms

| Term | Meaning in this chapter |
|------|-------------------------|
| DNS Filter | FortiGate profile that evaluates domain lookups before normal site access completes. |
| C2 | Command and Control infrastructure used by malware to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. |
| Static domain block | A manually configured domain pattern used for controlled filtering tests. |
| DNS log | Firewall evidence showing the queried domain, source, and action. |

## Steps Covered

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Enable botnet and C&C protection | The Office DNS Filter profile enables FortiGuard based blocking for known botnet and command and control destinations. |
| Create a controlled domain-blocking example | Facebook is added as a wildcard static domain filter example and assigned the redirect to block portal action. |
| Apply the DNS filter to outbound traffic | Office DNS Filter is enabled on the outbound firewall policy used by the workstation. |
| Validate the client block result | The workstation attempts to open the controlled domain and receives the configured FortiGate warning instead of the normal website. |
| Review DNS-filter logs | The DNS Filter log is reviewed to confirm that FortiGate processed the workstation's domain request and applied the configured block or redirect action. |

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 01 - Enable botnet and C&C protection

The `Office_DNS_Filter` profile enables FortiGuard-based blocking for known botnet and command-and-control destinations. If an infected system tries to resolve a listed control domain, FortiGate can block or redirect the request before the host reaches the attacker's server.

> Command-and-control infrastructure is used to issue instructions, receive stolen data, or update malware. DNS blocking is valuable because malicious infrastructure often changes IP addresses while continuing to rely on recognizable domain names.

### Step 02 - Create a controlled domain-blocking example

Facebook is added as a wildcard static domain-filter example and assigned the redirect-to-block-portal action. The familiar domain makes the test easy to recognize and demonstrates how a local administrator-defined rule can override normal resolution behavior.

> Facebook is not being classified as genuinely malicious in this exercise. It is a safe demonstration target used to prove the mechanics of a custom DNS rule without directing the workstation toward real command-and-control infrastructure.

### Step 03 - Apply the DNS filter to outbound traffic

`Office_DNS_Filter` is enabled on the outbound firewall policy used by the workstation. This connects the DNS inspection logic to matching client traffic so subsequent domain queries can be evaluated by the profile.

> Creating a DNS filter does not affect traffic until the correct policy references it. The policy path must also carry the client's DNS requests; otherwise the profile can be configured correctly and still produce no result.

---

### Step 04 - Validate the client block result

The workstation attempts to open the controlled domain and receives the configured FortiGate warning instead of the normal website. This shows that the DNS decision changed the user's connection path and redirected the request to the block portal.

> A client warning demonstrates the user experience, but the administrator should still verify the DNS log. That log confirms the queried name and action and helps distinguish DNS filtering from browser, routing, or web-filter issues.

### Step 05 - Review DNS-filter logs

The DNS Filter log is reviewed to confirm that FortiGate processed the workstation's domain request and applied the configured block or redirect action. The source, queried domain, and result provide the administrative explanation for the client warning.

> Client evidence and firewall evidence answer different questions. The warning shows what the user experienced, while the log shows which FortiGate control produced that experience and records it for troubleshooting or review.

---

## Validation

Validation combines a controlled client block result with FortiGate DNS-filter logs. The log view is the stronger administrative evidence because it identifies the queried domain and FortiGate action.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter completes the DNS-filtering workflow. The client warning and DNS-filter logs together show that FortiGate processed the domain lookup and applied the configured control.
