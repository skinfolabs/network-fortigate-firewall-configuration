# Administrator Access and Role-Based Control

This chapter documents FortiGate administrator role design. It shows how named accounts and restricted profiles reduce unnecessary privilege while preserving the access needed for monitoring, support, and controlled administration.

---

## Purpose

Create named FortiGate administrator identities and restrict administrative capabilities so operational access is tied to role, responsibility, and auditability.

## Technical Context

Administrative access is separated into named profiles instead of giving every operator unrestricted `super_admin` privileges. One profile demonstrates a powerful but selectively restricted administrator, while the IT profile provides view-only access to the operational areas required for monitoring and support.

This design makes the administrative plane part of the security architecture. Firewall rules protect network traffic, but administrator profiles protect the configuration itself by controlling who can change policies, security profiles, interfaces, and logs.

> Role-based access control reduces the impact of account compromise and human error. An operator who only needs to review policies or logs should not automatically be able to alter VPN settings, disable protection, or create new administrators.

**Implemented controls:**

- Created a restricted Super_Admin-like profile.
- Assigned a named administrator to the custom profile.
- Created an IT read-only profile and three administrator accounts.
- Validated the menus and permissions visible to restricted sessions.

## Key Technical Terms

| Term | Meaning in this chapter |
|------|-------------------------|
| RBAC | Role-Based Access Control, where permissions are assigned according to job role instead of giving every administrator full access. |
| Administrator profile | A FortiGate permission template that controls which configuration areas can be read, changed, or hidden. |
| Named administrator | A unique admin identity used for accountability instead of shared privileged access. |
| Read-only access | Permission to inspect configuration and logs without changing the firewall state. |

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 01 - Create a restricted administrator profile

A custom profile named `Special_Admin_Profile` is created under the FortiGate administrator-profile settings. It keeps broad access where administration is required, changes Log & Report to read-only, and hides or restricts selected areas such as System and Security Profiles. This produces a controlled alternative to assigning unrestricted `super_admin` rights.

> An administrator profile defines capability, while the administrator account defines identity. Keeping those objects separate allows the same permission design to be reviewed and reused without turning multiple operators into shared or anonymous super administrators.

---

### Step 02 - Create a named administrator account

The named account `Special_Admin` is created and assigned to `Special_Admin_Profile`. The account inherits the profile's permission boundaries when it signs in, so the restriction is enforced by FortiGate rather than relying on the operator to avoid sensitive menus.

> Named administrative accounts improve accountability because configuration changes and login events can be associated with a specific identity. Shared accounts weaken auditing and make it harder to determine who performed a risky change.

---

### Step 03 - Review the restricted administrator interface

After signing in with `Special_Admin`, several parts of the interface are reviewed. The screenshots show the active username, the reduced navigation, and the limited System and Security Profiles views. This confirms that the profile is actually applied to the session instead of existing only as an unused configuration object.

> Permission validation should be performed from the restricted account itself. Reviewing the profile as a super administrator proves how it was configured, but logging in as the delegated account proves what that operator can really see and use.

### Step 04 - Create a new IT administrator group and profile

The IT team is represented by an `IT_Group` administrator profile. Its permissions are limited to viewing operational areas such as firewall policies, logs, Virtual IPs, and interfaces. The profile centralizes this permission model so every assigned IT administrator receives the same controlled view.

> Read-only access supports troubleshooting without granting change authority. An IT operator can inspect the active configuration and logs, but sensitive modifications remain reserved for a more privileged administrative role.

<p><sub><strong>Screenshot 010 - IT Read-Only Profile:</strong> The `IT_Group` profile is configured with view-only access to the required operational sections.</sub></p>


---

### Step 05 - Create three IT administrators

Three named administrator accounts are created and assigned to `IT_Group`. Reusing one profile keeps the access model consistent across the team and makes later permission changes easier because the profile can be adjusted once instead of editing every account separately.

> Grouping administrators by job function is easier to audit than maintaining unrelated per-user permission sets. It also reduces configuration drift when several operators are expected to perform the same support duties.

<p><sub><strong>Screenshot 011 - IT Administrator Membership:</strong> Three IT administrator accounts are listed with the shared `IT_Group` profile.</sub></p>


---

### Step 06 - Validate read-only IT access

An IT administrator session is opened to verify the final result. Only the approved operational sections are available, and the interface shows that the account can review information without receiving unrestricted configuration rights.

> Least privilege is demonstrated by both access and restriction: the administrator must be able to reach the required monitoring views while remaining unable to modify unrelated security controls. A limited menu alone is not enough unless the available pages also enforce read-only behavior.

## Validation

The delegated-access checks are validated by signing in with the restricted accounts and reviewing the visible menus and read-only areas. This confirms that the profiles are not only configured but also affect the active administrator sessions.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter establishes the administrative access model for the lab. The screenshots validate both the profile configuration and the restricted administrator experience, which makes the later firewall changes easier to audit and control.
