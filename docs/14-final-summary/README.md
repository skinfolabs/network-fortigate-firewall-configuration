# Final Summary

The lab demonstrates a layered FortiGate deployment rather than a single firewall rule. Identity controls determine who can administer the device and who can use remote access. Network controls define which paths and services are allowed. Security profiles then inspect permitted traffic and provide client-side and log-based validation.

The project also records the difference between a working laboratory configuration and a production-ready design. Production deployment would require a supported FortiOS release, encrypted LDAP, trusted VPN and inspection certificates, MFA, service separation, and stricter least-privilege firewall rules.

## Validation Summary

| Control | Validation captured |
|---------|---------------------|
| Administrator RBAC | Restricted menus and read-only IT access |
| LDAP | Successful directory connection and imported users |
| SSL VPN Tunnel Mode | FortiClient connected and RDP desktop reached |
| SSL VPN Web Mode | Portal login, published bookmark, and browser RDP session |
| Destination NAT | IIS validated locally and through the external FortiGate address |
| IPsec | Tunnel status, directional policy configuration, RDP testing, and denied reverse ping |
| SSL/TLS inspection | Full-inspection profile attached to outbound policy |
| Web Filter | Reddit block, authentication prompt, and FortiGate logs |
| DNS Filter | Client block page and DNS-filter logs |
| Antivirus | Safe test sample blocked and logged |
| IPS | Client timeout correlated with a dropped IPS event |
| Application Control | TeamViewer block logs and two-day quarantine workflow |

## Production Recommendations

- Use named administrator accounts with MFA, restricted management access, and centralized logging for all privileged FortiGate access.
- Replace regular LDAP on port `389` with LDAPS or StartTLS, validate the directory certificate, and use a dedicated least-privileged bind account.
- Replace the laboratory VPN certificate with a trusted certificate that matches the public VPN FQDN before exposing SSL VPN to real users.
- Keep public web services separate from domain controllers. In this lab, IIS and Active Directory share AtlasAD only because the environment is isolated.
- Restrict inbound destination NAT policies to the exact required services and source ranges where possible.
- Keep the New York-to-Tel Aviv IPsec rule limited to the RDP service and review source and destination scopes before production use.
- Distribute and test a trusted inspection CA before using full SSL/TLS inspection with managed users.
- Review FortiOS firmware and security advisories before exposing any internet-facing firewall service. The lab screenshots show a critical-severity warning, but the exact FortiOS version is not recorded.
