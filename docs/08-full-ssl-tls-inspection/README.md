# Full SSL/TLS Inspection

This chapter covers outbound SSL/TLS inspection planning and policy attachment. It explains why encrypted traffic visibility matters and what the available evidence confirms.

## Technical Context

Encrypted traffic protects confidentiality between a client and a remote service, but it can also hide downloads, web requests, or application behavior from ordinary firewall inspection. Full SSL/TLS inspection allows FortiGate to act as an inspection intermediary: it decrypts the permitted session, applies the selected security profiles, and re-encrypts the connection toward its destination.

This chapter creates a dedicated inspection profile and attaches it to outbound traffic. The configuration prepares the firewall to inspect encrypted content that would otherwise be visible only as a TLS connection between two addresses.

> Deep inspection changes the certificate trust path seen by the client. The FortiGate inspection CA must be trusted by managed endpoints, and production deployment must account for privacy, certificate-pinned applications, legal requirements, and explicit bypass categories.

**Implemented controls:**

- Created `Office_To_Internet_Inspection` in Full SSL Inspection mode.
- Selected the FortiGate laboratory inspection CA.
- Applied the profile to the outbound firewall policy.
- Documented the additional trust and validation requirements for production.

Production recommendation: full inspection requires a trusted inspection CA distributed to managed clients, privacy review, application exceptions, and staged compatibility testing. The lab shows the profile and policy attachment, not a full enterprise certificate rollout.

## Key Technical Terms

| Term | Meaning in this chapter |
|------|-------------------------|
| SSL/TLS inspection | Firewall inspection of encrypted sessions so security profiles can evaluate traffic contents. |
| Inspection CA | The certificate authority FortiGate uses to re-sign inspected sessions for managed clients. |
| Full inspection | Deeper TLS inspection that requires client trust in the FortiGate inspection certificate. |
| Policy attachment | The step that makes an inspection profile apply to real matching traffic. |

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 01 - Create the inspection profile

The `Office_To_Internet_Inspection` profile is configured for full inspection using the FortiGate laboratory CA. The profile determines which encrypted protocols are inspected and which CA FortiGate uses when generating certificates for the client-facing side of inspected TLS sessions.

> The selected certificate is sufficient for demonstrating profile configuration in this isolated lab. In a managed environment, clients must trust the inspection CA or they will receive certificate warnings, and sensitive or incompatible applications may require carefully reviewed exemptions.

### Step 02 - Apply inspection to outbound traffic

The profile is attached to the firewall policy carrying traffic from the office network toward the internet. This placement ensures that encrypted sessions matching the outbound rule are handed to the full-inspection profile before the later Web Filter, Antivirus, IPS, or Application Control decisions are made.

> Creating a security profile does nothing until a matching firewall policy references it. The screenshot confirms policy attachment; client trust deployment and decrypted-session testing remain separate production validation items.

## Validation and Summary

Validation confirms that the full-inspection profile exists and is attached to the outbound policy. Production validation would additionally test certificate trust, browser behavior, inspected sessions, and security-profile detections over HTTPS.

This chapter completes the SSL/TLS inspection setup shown in the lab. The evidence confirms profile creation and policy attachment, while full production use would still require certificate trust deployment and compatibility testing.
